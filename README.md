# Eat Da Burger

Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers that they'd like to eat, made using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger's name on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the `Burgers to Devour` section also has a `Devour` button.  When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
